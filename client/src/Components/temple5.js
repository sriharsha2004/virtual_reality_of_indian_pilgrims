            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
            The Somnath temple, also called Somanātha temple or Deo Patan, is a Hindu temple located in Prabhas Patan, Veraval in Gujarat, India. It is one of the most sacred pilgrimage sites for Hindus and is believed to be first among the twelve jyotirlinga shrines of Shiva. The temple was reconstructed several times in the past after repeated destruction by multiple Muslim invaders and rulers, notably starting from an attack by Mahmud Ghazni in the 11th century.It is unclear when the first version of the Somnath temple was built with estimates varying between the early centuries of the 1st-millennium to about the 9th-century CE.

        The Somnath temple was actively studied by colonial era historians and archaeologists in the 19th- and early 20th-century, when its ruins illustrated a historic Hindu temple in the process of being converted into an Islamic mosque. After India's independence, those ruins were demolished and the present Somnath temple was reconstructed in the Māru-Gurjara style of Hindu temple architecture. The contemporary Somnath temple's reconstruction was started under the orders of the first Home Minister of India Vallabhbhai Patel and completed in May 1951 after his death.

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
        The site of Somnath has been a pilgrimage site from ancient times on account of being a Triveni Sangam (the confluence of three rivers: Kapila, Hiran and Saraswati). Soma, the Moon god, is believed to have lost his lustre due to a curse, and he bathed in the Sarasvati River at this site to regain it. The result is said to be the waxing and waning of the moon. The name of the town, Prabhas, meaning lustre, as well as the alternative names Someshvar and Somnath ("the lord of the moon" or "the moon god"), arise from this tradition. 


        The name Someshvara begins to appear starting in the 9th century. The Gurjara-Pratihara king Nagabhata II (r. 805–833) recorded that he has visited tirthas in Saurashtra, including Someshvara.[36] Romila Thapar states that this does not imply the existence of a temple, but rather that it was a pilgrimage site (tirtha). The Chaulukya (Solanki) king Mularaja possibly built the first temple for Soma at the site sometime before 997 CE, even though some historians believe that he may have renovated a smaller earlier temple.

The post-1950 excavations of the Somnath site have unearthed the earliest known version of the Somnath temple. The excavations showed the foundations of a 10th-century temple, notable broken parts and details of a major, well decorated version of a temple. Madhusudan Dhaky believes it to have been the one that was destroyed by Mahmud of Ghazni.B.K. Thapar, the archaeologist who did the excavation, stated that there was definitely a temple structure at Somnath-Patan in the 9th-century, but none before.

        <h2>Construction</h2>
        <p>India’s Iron Man and First Deputy Prime Minister Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel on November 13, 1947 promised to rebuild the temple. Today’s Somnath Temple is built on its original place in seventh place. When the temple was rebuilt on December 1, 1995, then the Indian President Dr. Shankar Dayal Sharma dedicated the temple to the country. In 1951, when India’s first President Dr. When Rajendra Prasad proposed to purify Jyotirling, he said, “This temple of Somnath is a symbol of victory over construction on destruction”. [Citation needed] The temple is built under Shri Somnath Trust And this trust is now monitoring the temple. Currently the chairman of the trust is former chief minister Keshubhai Patel and Sardar Patel was the first chairman of this trust. 

The Kailash Mahameru Prasad Temple, built by Chalukya style, has a spectacular display of the art of Sompura artisans of Gujarat. This type of construction has not happened in the last 800 years. According to the inscription written in Sanskrit on the coast, only the sea exists between the temple and the southern part of the planet and there is no land.</p>
