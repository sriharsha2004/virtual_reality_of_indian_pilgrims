        According to Skanda Purana, Yada Maharishi, son of venerated Maharshi Rishyasringa performed penance here to Lord Vishnu as Narasimha. Being pleased with his penance lord appeared before him and manifested himself in five forms: Jwaalaa Narasimha, Gandabheranda Narasimha, Yogananda Narasimha, Ugra Narasimha and Lakshmi Narasimha .Yada Maharishi begged Narasimha to remain on the hill in these forms. For this reason, the Lakshmi-Narasimhadeva temple on the hilltop has deities of Narasimha in all five forms embedded in stone in the main cave. Historically, the temple has followed the Thenkalai tradition of the Vaishnava Agama Shastras as followed in South India.

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
        In Tretayugam, there lived a sage by the name of Yadarishi, son of the great sage Rishyasrunga and Santa Devi who did penance inside a cave with the blessings of Anjaneya (Hanuman) on this hill between Bhongir (Bhuvanagiri) and Raigiri (Now in Nalgonda district of Telangana, India). Pleased with his deep devotion, Lord Narasimha, an incarnation of Lord Vishnu appeared before him in five different forms as Sri JwalaNarasimha ,Sri  Yogananda,  SriGandabherunda, Sri Ugra and Sri  Lakshminarasimha. All these five forms (roopas) are presently worshipped within the temple. They later manifested themselves into finely sculpted forms that later came to be worshiped as Pancha Narasimha Kshetram.

        There are Purana and traditional accounts of this Shrine, which are widely popular among the devotees. There is mention about the origin of this temple in the Skanda Purana, one of the famous 18 puranas. Glowing bright atop the sikharam of garbha griha (Sanctum Sanctorum) of this cave temple is the golden Sudarshana Chakra (about 3 ft x 3ft) of Lord Vishnu (whose reincarnation is Lord Narasimha), the adornment as well as the weapon is a symbol this temple is identified by from as far away as 6 km. It is said that many years ago the chakra moved in the direction from which the devotees came as if like a compass guiding them towards the temple.The Chakra Considered to posses mystic power and value, at times turns on its own ; no human hand is capable of turning it.

        <p>The principal film set designer is Anand Sai and lead architect P Madhusudhan, chosen for their understanding of the ancient designs based on silpa and Agama principles. The entire temple is built in stone. The stone designs in Yadadri were provided by the chief sthapathi of the temple, Sundararajan Srinivasan.
        Hundreds of sculptors and artisans are working round the clock to give final touches to this magnificent 1,000-year-old Vaishnavaite temple, which civil engineers and civic officials are racing against the time to complete the necessary civic infrastructure to provide all amenities for the pilgrims.
